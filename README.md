# OOP Notes Repository 🚀

Welcome to this totally-random-but-kinda-useful collection of OOP notes.  
This repo is a mix of:
- Notes generated by ChatGPT 🤖  
- Bits borrowed from Kunal Kushwaha’s legendary explanations 📘  
- And… yes, a generous sprinkle of boredom ✨

If you're actually trying to *learn* OOP, I highly recommend watching **Kunal Kushwaha's OOP playlist** while going through these notes. His teaching + these notes = solid understanding.

But seriously—**make your own notes** too.  
This repo is more like a “timepass compilation” than a textbook.

Enjoy, explore, and happy coding! 😄
